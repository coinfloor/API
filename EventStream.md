# Event Stream

Version 2
* https://webapi.coinfloor.co.uk/v2/event-stream

Coinfloor offers an Event Stream resource that complies with the [Server-Sent Events] specification by the W3C. This resource delivers a continuous, consistent stream of events related to market and account activity on the Coinfloor platform. It is offered as a simpler alternative to Coinfloor's [WebSocket API] for clients that do not require bidirectional communication with the platform.

The Event Stream resource supports the standard `Last-Event-ID` request header to enable transiently disconnected clients to reconnect and resume the event stream without missing any events. See the [Server-Sent Events] specification for details.

## Authentication

The Event Stream resource may be requested without authentication, in which case only public events (order book and ticker changes) are returned.

Requests for the Event Stream resource may authenticate using [HTTP Basic Authentication], wherein the *user-id* is the concatenation of user's numeric ID, a slash, and the user's Base64-encoded API key, and the *password* is the user's password or the Base64 encoding of the user's 28-byte private key that is derived from the user's ID and password. Authenticated requests will receive account-private events (balance changes and more details on the user's own order events) in addition to the public events.
